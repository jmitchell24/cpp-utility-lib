cpp-utility-lib
=======
A small utility library that I have made while working on my C++ projects. 

## Features
* An implementation of my custom config file format (named 'cml' in code)
* A PLY (Polygon File Format) implementation
* A modern (C++11) implementation of Don Clugston's Fast Delegates (faster than std::function!)
* Mathematical utilities for linear algebra, collision detection, and more
* String utilities including a type-safe printf implementation (all utilities are char-size agnostic)
* Other smaller utilities that I found useful when working on my own projects
